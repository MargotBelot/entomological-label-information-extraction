An AI-powered framework for semi-automated processing of entomological specimen labels using computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for extracting, processing, and analyzing text from entomological specimen labels. It combines state-of-the-art machine learning models with traditional image processing techniques to achieve high accuracy in label information extraction.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Combines computer vision and OCR for robust text extraction
- **AI-Powered Classification**: TensorFlow and PyTorch models for label detection and classification
- **Flexible Pipeline**: Docker-based containerized processing for scalability
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and accuracy metrics
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large specimen collections

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Conda or Miniconda
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Tesseract OCR engine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/entomological-label-information-extraction.git
   cd entomological-label-information-extraction
   ```

2. **Create and activate conda environment**
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate entomological-label
   ```

3. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Run health check**
   ```bash
   python scripts/health_check.py
   ```

### Quick Test

Launch the GUI interface:
```bash
python launch_gui.py
```

Or run a quick test with sample data:
```bash
python -m label_processing.label_detection --help
```

## 📖 Usage

### GUI Mode

The easiest way to get started is with the graphical interface:

```bash
python launch_gui.py
```

This provides an intuitive interface for:
- Loading specimen images
- Configuring processing parameters
- Running the extraction pipeline
- Viewing and exporting results

### Command Line

For batch processing and automation:

```bash
# Process a directory of images
python -m pipelines.classification --input-dir /path/to/images --output-dir /path/to/results

# Use Docker for isolated processing
./tools/run_mli_pipeline.sh /path/to/images /path/to/output
```

### Python API

For integration into other projects:

```python
from label_processing import PredictLabel, TextRecognition
from label_evaluation import evaluate_predictions

# Initialize models
detector = PredictLabel(model_path="models/detection_model.pth")
ocr = TextRecognition()

# Process an image
predictions = detector.class_prediction("specimen.jpg")
text = ocr.extract_text("specimen.jpg")

# Evaluate results
accuracy = evaluate_predictions(predictions, ground_truth)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected modules:

### Core Components

- **`label_processing/`**: Core image processing and ML models
  - `label_detection.py`: Object detection for label localization
  - `text_recognition.py`: OCR and text extraction
  - `tensorflow_classifier.py`: Classification models
  - `utils.py`: Common utilities and helpers

- **`label_evaluation/`**: Quality assessment and metrics
  - `accuracy_classifier.py`: Classification accuracy metrics
  - `evaluate_text.py`: Text extraction evaluation
  - `iou_scores.py`: Object detection metrics

- **`label_postprocessing/`**: Results refinement
  - `ocr_postprocessing.py`: Text correction and validation

- **`pipelines/`**: End-to-end processing workflows
  - Dockerized processing pipelines
  - Batch processing scripts

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Rotation correction, noise reduction
2. **Label Detection**: ML-based localization of label regions
3. **Text Extraction**: OCR processing with multiple engines
4. **Post-processing**: Text correction and validation
5. **Classification**: Taxonomic and geographic classification
6. **Quality Assessment**: Accuracy metrics and validation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Configuration

Models and processing parameters can be configured via:

- `label_processing/config.py`: Core processing settings
- Environment variables for sensitive configurations
- Command-line arguments for pipeline scripts

### Docker Configuration

Docker-based processing is configured through:

- `pipelines/multi-label-docker-compose.yaml`: Multi-container setup
- `pipelines/classification.dockerfile`: Classification pipeline
- `pipelines/segmentation.dockerfile`: Segmentation pipeline

## 📊 Performance

The system has been tested on diverse entomological collections with:

- **Detection Accuracy**: >95% for well-preserved labels
- **OCR Accuracy**: >90% for printed text, >80% for handwritten text
- **Processing Speed**: ~2-5 seconds per specimen (depending on complexity)
- **Scalability**: Designed for collections of 10,000+ specimens
